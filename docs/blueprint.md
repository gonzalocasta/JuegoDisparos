# **App Name**: Retro Star Savior

## Core Features:

- Score Tracking: Tracks and displays the user's score as they convert opponents into stars.
- Life Counter: Keeps track of the player's remaining lives and displays them on screen.
- Collision Detection: Detects collisions between the player, opponents, and shots to trigger score updates, life deductions, or game over scenarios.
- Level Progression: Implements multiple levels with increasing difficulty, introducing new enemy patterns and challenges.
- Final Boss: Introduces a more powerful boss opponent (pentagon) that moves at twice the speed of the regular opponent (triangle) when the regular opponent is defeated.
- Game Over Screen: Displays a 'game over' or 'you win' screen based on whether the player runs out of lives or defeats the final boss.
- Dynamic Opponent: Replaces a killed regular opponent with a new Boss opponent instance. The game presents this new challenge to the player.
- Congratulations Screen: Displays a 'Congratulations!' screen when the player completes all levels.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Neon blue (#0FF) to evoke a retro arcade feel.
- Background color: Black (#000) to enhance the contrast and make the neon colors pop.
- Accent color: Bright pink (#F0F) for highlighting interactive elements, score, and life counters, complementing the neon blue.
- Body and headline font: 'Press Start 2P' (pixel font) to give a classic 8-bit video game appearance.
- Pixelated icons for lives and score, reminiscent of retro games. Use pixelated star icons for converted opponents.
- Simple and clean layout, but with a slight CRT filter effect to simulate old arcade monitors. Score and lives are prominently displayed at the top.
- Simple, blocky animations for opponent conversions, shots, and game over/win screens, maintaining the retro aesthetic. Consider scanline effects.
